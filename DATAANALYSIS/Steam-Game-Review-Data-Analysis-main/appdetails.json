Trespassing in a movie studio?</h2>Every mission in A Hat in Time is unique! At one moment you'll be solving the <strong>Murder on the Owl Express</strong> by finding clues and interrogating the locals, the next moment you'll be the band marshal in <strong>The Big Parade</strong>, or sneaking through the bird-run <strong>Dead Bird Studio</strong>!<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/253230/extras/alpine.jpg?t=1589582654\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Small child, giant worlds</h2>Jump freely around in 5 massive worlds with new adventures to discover around every corner! Just like any child, Hat Kid loves to climb and explore, no mountain is too big for her sense of adventure. She can do multiple jump moves, as well as climb walls, and swing over gaps!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Cute hats, magical yarn and snappy badges</h2>By finding and collecting rare magical yarn, Hat Kid can stitch new cute hats with a variety of abilities, including a witch hat that allows her to cook explosive concoctions, and a wooden ghost mask that allows her to peek into other dimensions. Hats can become even more powerful, by attaching badges that are found, sold and traded by the locals!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Community-funded, community-focused</h2>A Hat in Time was successfully funded on Kickstarter, reaching nearly 10 times its goal!

We have rolled back the game to Summer of 2014, when it first left Early Access and was still being developed by us, Phosphor Games Studio.  <br><br><strong>RIGHT NOW</strong>:<br>- Single Player enabled: It was not possible before, but now it's working, and it's hard!  Have fun surviving the monster-filled urban apocalypse alone<br>- No more micro-transactions: all items can be bought with in game cash<br>- Multiplayer via player hosted servers! The old back end ripped out - no need for any login besides Steam.  You control your community, and nobody can take your game from you again<br><br><strong>WHAT IS IN DEVELOPMENT</strong>:<br>- Custom server settings: you decided how many players, how many Nether, how much gun spawns, etc.<br>- Modding tools![/b]<br>- Bug fixes (including playing as a Nether, which was always pretty buggy<br><br><strong>GAME SUMMARY</strong>:<br>Nether is a fast-paced survival game that forces you to make quick life-saving decisions in an unforgiving environment. In this post-apocalyptic urban world, death is waiting around every corner, at the top of high-rise buildings, and in the grasp of powerful teleporting creatures known as 'Nethers'. These creatures and the other players are real challenges to overcome, requiring tactical gameplay, awareness, stealth, and cooperation. To navigate this high-tension environment, you must use skill and cunning in order to scavenge, trade, craft or loot for food, weapons, supplies, and other resources necessary to stay alive in a desolate and dangerous city. Team up with other survivors and take advantage of group play, as a tribe, to complete treacherous world objectives, or play as a lone wolf in an attempt to endure the hostile environment. In the end you must decide whether to Prey or Pray.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br><strong>EXPLORE</strong><br>The game's landscape is a beautifully conceived vision of a post apocalyptic Chicago, ravaged by disaster and time. Almost every low and high-rise building can be individually explored in a cityscape that stretches 150 blocks. Beyond the city lies the Wastelands, an unforgiving desolate landscape that is slowly sinking into the earth. <br><br><strong>SURVIVE, CRAFT, TRADE, LOOT AND SHOOT</strong><br>Start off, armed only with a kitchen knife and scavenge your way through an environment on a daily battle to stay alive. Beware the Nether, poor mutated souls who roam the city in search of human flesh. Scavenge for food and water to stay nourished, and search for useful items that could be crafted into makeshift weapons to help in your battle for life.  Hunt and kill Nether to trade their body parts to the mysterious Cult located in the few markets that scatter the city. Over time, build up your skills and earn rewards for surviving each precious new day. But always beware of the other survivors who may be only one moment away from death, and see killing you and looting your possessions as their only salvation. <br><br><strong>TRIBES AND TERRITORY WARS </strong><br>Find safety in numbers by joining a tribe. Only tribes can capture and own territory, and the urban landscape is the perfect setting for turf domination. Compete with rival tribes in territory wars for control of the city by capturing strategic landmarks to reap resources and experience; prove your dominance over all other tribes. Spy on rival tribes or infiltrate and kill them by playing as a Nether. Ambush them from above by swooping in for the kill using the wing suit. Tribes change the survival experience by establishing a true social construct, with all the consequences of behavior that you would expect in the real world.

We have rolled back the game to Summer of 2014, when it first left Early Access and was still being developed by us, Phosphor Games Studio.  <br><br><strong>RIGHT NOW</strong>:<br>- Single Player enabled: It was not possible before, but now it's working, and it's hard!  Have fun surviving the monster-filled urban apocalypse alone<br>- No more micro-transactions: all items can be bought with in game cash<br>- Multiplayer via player hosted servers! The old back end ripped out - no need for any login besides Steam.  You control your community, and nobody can take your game from you again<br><br><strong>WHAT IS IN DEVELOPMENT</strong>:<br>- Custom server settings: you decided how many players, how many Nether, how much gun spawns, etc.<br>- Modding tools![/b]<br>- Bug fixes (including playing as a Nether, which was always pretty buggy<br><br><strong>GAME SUMMARY</strong>:<br>Nether is a fast-paced survival game that forces you to make quick life-saving decisions in an unforgiving environment. In this post-apocalyptic urban world, death is waiting around every corner, at the top of high-rise buildings, and in the grasp of powerful teleporting creatures known as 'Nethers'. These creatures and the other players are real challenges to overcome, requiring tactical gameplay, awareness, stealth, and cooperation. To navigate this high-tension environment, you must use skill and cunning in order to scavenge, trade, craft or loot for food, weapons, supplies, and other resources necessary to stay alive in a desolate and dangerous city. Team up with other survivors and take advantage of group play, as a tribe, to complete treacherous world objectives, or play as a lone wolf in an attempt to endure the hostile environment. In the end you must decide whether to Prey or Pray.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Key Features</h2><br><strong>EXPLORE</strong><br>The game's landscape is a beautifully conceived vision of a post apocalyptic Chicago, ravaged by disaster and time. Almost every low and high-rise building can be individually explored in a cityscape that stretches 150 blocks. Beyond the city lies the Wastelands, an unforgiving desolate landscape that is slowly sinking into the earth. <br><br><strong>SURVIVE, CRAFT, TRADE, LOOT AND SHOOT</strong><br>Start off, armed only with a kitchen knife and scavenge your way through an environment on a daily battle to stay alive. Beware the Nether, poor mutated souls who roam the city in search of human flesh. Scavenge for food and water to stay nourished, and search for useful items that could be crafted into makeshift weapons to help in your battle for life.  Hunt and kill Nether to trade their body parts to the mysterious Cult located in the few markets that scatter the city. Over time, build up your skills and earn rewards for surviving each precious new day. But always beware of the other survivors who may be only one moment away from death, and see killing you and looting your possessions as their only salvation. <br><br><strong>TRIBES AND TERRITORY WARS </strong><br>Find safety in numbers by joining a tribe. Only tribes can capture and own territory, and the urban landscape is the perfect setting for turf domination. Compete with rival tribes in territory wars for control of the city by capturing strategic landmarks to reap resources and experience; prove your dominance over all other tribes. Spy on rival tribes or infiltrate and kill them by playing as a Nether. Ambush them from above by swooping in for the kill using the wing suit. Tribes change the survival experience by establishing a true social construct, with all the consequences of behavior that you would expect in the real world. Your actions have real repercussions enforced organically through reputation and standing.<br><br><strong>PLAYER AND GROUP MISSIONS</strong><br>Players can complete an assortment of individual or group missions to earn money, experience and reputation.

Don't Escape: 4 Days to Survive is a post-apocalyptic thriller from veteran developer Scriptwelder, creator of the popular horror series Deep Sleep and Don't Escape.

Each chapter of the game has multiple potential variations to encounter, from poisonous fog or spiders to a gang of murderous thugs or a deadly heat wave, and as a result, you'll need to adjust your strategy on different playthroughs.

Everything is already dead or dying... except you. Or so you think. Don't Escape: 4 Days to Survive is a post-apocalyptic thriller from veteran developer Scriptwelder, creator of the popular horror series Deep Sleep and Don't Escape. Players must figure out a way to properly fortify their home against each night's new danger, as they learn the truth behind the apocalypse and search for a way to safety, if one exists.<br><br><img src=\"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/611760/extras/spider_gif_(1).gif?t=1594324734\" /><br><br>Players will journey alongside David, a lone survivor after the end of the world, who finds himself having prophetic dreams... or nightmares. Each chapter of the game has multiple potential variations to encounter, from poisonous fog or spiders to a gang of murderous thugs or a deadly heat wave, and as a result, you'll need to adjust your strategy on different playthroughs. But you don't have forever.

You will be mining resources, researching technologies, building infrastructure, automating production and fighting enemies. In the beginning you will find yourself chopping trees, mining ores and crafting mechanical arms and transport belts by hand, but in short time you can become an industrial powerhouse, with huge solar fields, oil refining and cracking, manufacture and deployment of construction and logistic robots, all for your resource needs. However this heavy exploitation of the planet's resources does not sit nicely with the locals, so you will have to be prepared to defend yourself and your machine empire. <br><br>Join forces with other players in cooperative <strong>Multiplayer</strong>, create huge factories, collaborate and delegate tasks between you and your friends.

You don't have more 'hitpoints' than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you work for it.<br><br></li><li><strong>Build a base</strong> where you can research new technologies, upgrade your defences and craft new gear. <br><br></li><li><strong>Purchase and upgrade your own buildings</strong> to use as safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a business. <br><br></li><li><strong>Variation and possibilities of gameplay. </strong>Be good, be evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city. Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself. <br><br></li><li><strong>Dynamic, ever changing world. </strong>Support or hinder whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won't stop moving. This is not just a &quot;game&quot;, you are living and surviving in a simulated world.<br><br></li><li><strong>Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive</strong>, or sold off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you have the strength. <br><br></li><li><strong>Absolutely no Level-scaling.</strong> The world does not level up along with you, and the shops don't change their inventory to only items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The game won't hold your hand or help you when you're down. <br><br></li><li><strong>Realistic medical system that affects gameplay.</strong> A character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will attract predators. A character\u2019s stats are affected by equipment, encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation. <br><br></li><li><strong>Intelligent AI</strong> that allows for characters to reason and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of micromanagement for you and run production in your base. <br><br></li><li><strong>Aid or oppose the various factions</strong> in the world while striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in the harsh environment. <br><br></li><li><strong>Independently developed </strong>with no design influences, or alterations dictated by men in gray suits who have never played a game before in their lives. <br><br></li><li><strong>Original game world. </strong>There are no fantasy-knock-off cliches. No magic.</li></ul>", "short_description": "A free-roaming squad based RPG. Focusing on open-ended sandbox gameplay features rather than a linear story.
